    <!-- The <style> attribute is a CSS funtion that changes the look and feel of a HTML webpage.
        Some code for CSS is done within an HTML page, but copious amounts of code are done within 
        a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML file. The same process is done with JavaScript that is done 
        within HTML-->

    <!-- Adding a class to an element can make coding easier when it comes to detailing. Other languages such as CSS and 
        JavaScript benefit greatly from classes being added to elements in coding. It is possible to apply changes
        to all elements simultaneously, however if you specify a class within an element, that class takes precedence over the element.
        This means you can make changes to a specific class within an element without changing all elements. -->
